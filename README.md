# Asteroid-Game
A basic topdown game of a laser unicorn cat shooting asteroids
This is a simple python game using pygame in which you play as a unicorn cat shooting lasers (purple squares) at asteroids (green and red squares).
Green asteroids give you health when they are shot or collide into you.
Red asteroids give you less score and injure you if they hit you.
The player sprite always remains in the centre, the other particles are accelerated depending on the key you press.
WASD to accelerate in that direction
Arrow keys to shoot lasers
Space to slow down to a halt
B to display FPS in the console
